# PulseDev MCP Prompts Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've successfully implemented a comprehensive collection of specialized system prompts for PulseDev that enable Claude to emulate the behavior of various AI coding tools through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture. This implementation eliminates the need for separate API keys for each tool while providing their specialized capabilities.

## Key Components Implemented

1. **MCP Prompts Collection**
   - Created a collection of 10 specialized system prompts organized by source platform
   - Each prompt tunes Claude to emulate specific tool behaviors
   - Included a unified prompt that combines capabilities from all tools

2. **MCP Direct Bridge Enhanced**
   - Added prompt loading and management capabilities
   - Implemented system prompt switching functionality
   - Created methods to list and inspect available prompts
   - Updated request handling to include system prompts

3. **AI Assistant Service Extended**
   - Added specialized behavior through different system prompts
   - Implemented methods to manage and switch between prompts
   - Created a task-type based prompt selection system
   - Added prompt metadata access capabilities

4. **API Endpoints for Prompt Management**
   - Created endpoints to list and inspect available prompts
   - Implemented endpoint to load and activate specific prompts
   - Updated existing endpoints to support prompt customization
   - Added specialized assistance endpoint with task-type targeting

## Specialized Prompt Categories

We've implemented prompts for a variety of specialized tools:

| Category | Tool | Focus Area |
|----------|------|------------|
| Code Development | Cursor | General code writing and assistance |
| Code Development | VSCode | Context-aware coding assistance |
| Command Execution | Replit | Terminal operations and commands |
| UI/UX Design | Lovable | User experience and interface design |
| UI/UX Design | Rork | Component architecture and design |
| Presentations | Gamma | Slide decks and visual presentations |
| Documentation | Same.dev | Technical writing and collaboration |
| Project Planning | Devin | Autonomous development capabilities |
| Agent Development | Manus | Agent behavior programming |
| Combined | PulseDev | Full-stack development lifecycle |

## Integration with MCP

- The MCP Direct Bridge connects to the MCP server via WebSockets
- System prompts are loaded from YAML files in the `mcp_prompts` directory
- Requests include the appropriate system prompt for the task
- No API keys required, using the existing MCP infrastructure

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Specialized Assistance**
   - Users can access different AI tool capabilities without switching between platforms
   - Each specialized mode provides tailored assistance for specific tasks
   - Task-type based automatic prompt selection simplifies the experience

2. **Flexible Configuration**
   - Front-end can choose prompts based on current context or user preference
   - All existing API endpoints support optional prompt specifications
   - Prompts can be changed on-the-fly between requests

3. **Extensibility**
   - New prompts can be added by simply creating YAML files in the prompt directory
   - No code changes required to add new specialized behaviors
   - Prompts can be customized to meet specific project needs

## Future Enhancements

1. **Auto-Detection of Appropriate Prompts**
   - Analyze user queries to automatically select the most appropriate prompt
   - Consider file context and project type in prompt selection

2. **Prompt Composition**
   - Allow combining capabilities from multiple prompts when appropriate
   - Create custom prompts tailored to specific project requirements

3. **Additional Specialized Prompts**
   - Expand the collection with prompts for more specialized tools
   - Create domain-specific prompts for industries or tech stacks

4. **Prompt Evolution**
   - Refine prompts based on user feedback and performance
   - Track prompt effectiveness for different task types

## Documentation

- Updated `README_CLAUDE_INTEGRATION.md` with comprehensive prompt information
- Created clear usage examples for different specialized modes
- Documented API endpoints for prompt management
- Added troubleshooting guidance for prompt-related issues
