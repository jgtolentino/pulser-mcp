  ## Review Guidelines

  Analyze the deck for:

  1. **Clarity**: Are messages clear and easy to understand?
  2. **Conciseness**: Is content appropriately brief for slides? 
  3. **Flow**: Does the narrative progress logically?
  4. **Impact**: Are points compelling and persuasive?
  5. **Tone**: Is the tone appropriate for the intended audience?
  6. **Actionability**: Do slides drive toward clear next steps?

  ## Output Format

  Provide your feedback as JSON with two sections:
  1. Overall feedback on the entire deck
  2. Specific feedback for individual slides
